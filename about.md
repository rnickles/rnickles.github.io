I'm a software engineering student living in Berkeley. I enjoy cooking, rock climbing,  music (listening and making), and skateboarding.

In this gif I'm controlling a 3D model with my physical motion. My webcam is filming me, MediaPipe identifies around twenty pose points which are then used to control the 3D model.
It's also a proof of performance: the entire workflow utilizes the webcam, machine learning for the image processing, 3D rendering, all over a playing video -- in realtime.
