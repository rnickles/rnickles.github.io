Herman Melville’s classic novel Moby-Dick is a sweeping saga of the high seas, populated by memorable characters and full of exciting adventure. Yet beneath its surface lies an intricate exploration into man's relationship with nature that has made it one of literature's greatest works. From its evocative language to the way it parallels other great literary works such as Shakespeare’s The Tempest and Milton’s Paradise Lost, Moby-Dick is a prime example of Herman Melville’s mastery over his craft. 

One technique employed by Melville in this masterpiece is personification. For example, he gives mythical creature qualities to the titular white whale—Moby Dick—describing him as “an unearthly thing…a demoniac laughter…an incarnation of all horror." By making Moby Dick almost supernatural in nature, we understand how powerful and dangerous he can be even before meeting him face to face. This style also applies to some of the human characters such as Captain Ahab who have been compared mythic figures like Achilles because their quest for revenge becomes so obsessive that nothing else matters; they are willing to risk everything for what will ultimately become their own downfall. 

The use symbolism plays an important role too: water symbolizes life itself while whales represent freedom from society's boundaries or limitations; both being metaphors for humanity's journey through life towards self-discovery (the infamous "white whale"). Even everyday objects are given symbolic meaning: Queequeg’s coffin stands out here since it literally represents death but metaphorically serves as a rebirth due Ishmael emerging alive on board ship afterwards – something which not only sets up much later events in book but also reflects our search for identity within ourselves after going through difficult times/experiences in our lives.  

Finally, there is religious imagery throughout– mainly derived from Christianity – comparing Ahab‘s struggle against God himself (reflected in many Biblical references). Other examples include Elijah speaking from Heaven at various moments or when Father Mapple delivers his sermon about Jonah &c., demonstrating how religion can shape our understanding & perception world around us regardless if we follow faith or not - particularly during troubled times where no other answers seem available.. In short, these layers give readers new insights into complex themes like destiny vs free will and good vs evil which serve make this book timeless source entertainment pleasure today just much did upon publication 1851!
